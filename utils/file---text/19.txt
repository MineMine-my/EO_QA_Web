presence of the alkali species. Ethylene epoxidation experiments were performed both in the absence and
presence of the industrially vital ethyl chloride promoter. Without the chloride, the alkali-promoted catalysts
were less active than the silver reference catalyst and showed a decreased primary ethylene oxide (EO) selec-
tivity. Introducing ethyl chloride to the feed increased the primary EO selectivity of all catalysts to ca. 80%
without sacrificing the activity for the alkali-promoted catalysts. Systematic EO isomerization experiments
revealed that the secondary reactions of EO are inhibited by alkali promoters on the silver surface rather than on
the support. Larger/less electronegative alkali species such as Rb and Cs inhibited EO degradation to a greater
extent than Li and Na. However, when ethyl chloride was introduced to the feed the EO conversion of all cat-
alysts was blocked. This study hence demonstrates how the combination of chloride and alkali promoters affects
the Ag sites, specifically suppressing both undesired combustion and promoting desired ethylene epoxidation
when increasing the conversion.

To study whether the secondary reactions of EO are inhibited by
alkali promoters on the silver surface rather than on the support, pro-
moted Ag catalysts were investigated. Flowing EO resulted in a similar
EO conversion as the α-Al2O3 (Fig. 5B), suggesting that EO isomerization
is not affected by the introduction of active silver surface. However,
when oxygen is added to the gas feed there are vast differences in EO
conversion. The Ag catalyst shows an EO conversion of 70%, suggesting
that EO degradation is more dominant of the Ag surface than on the
α-alumina support. When larger/less electronegative alkali species are
present the EO conversion gradually decreases to 15%. This is inter-
esting, since the molar ratio between Ag and the alkali is similar for all
catalysts (except for Na-Ag). These EO conversions scale with both the
alkali electronegativity and cation radius (Fig. S6E–F), hence it is
difficult to differentiate between geometric and electronic effects.
Interesting in this respect would be to study alkali and alkaline earth
