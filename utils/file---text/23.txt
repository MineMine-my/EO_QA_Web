meticulously detailed in the methodology. Unpromoted silver nanowires exhibited superior ethylene oxide
selectivity compared to both unpromoted and promoted spherical catalysts. Additionally, the ethylene oxide
selectivity was enhanced with the addition of the promoter, achieving activity and selectivity levels comparable
to the best reported in the literature. Morphological analysis of spent silver nanowire catalysts revealed

corroborated computational findings, demonstrating that silver nano-
wires and nanocubes exhibit higher EO selectivity at comparable
ethylene conversion levels compared to silver spherical particles [22].
However, numerous unanswered questions persist, highlighting the
need for further studies to reveal deeper insights.
There are various synthesis methods for silver nanowires [25]. The
modified polyol method stands out as one of the most popular due to its
cost-effectiveness, mild reaction conditions, and suitability for industrial
production [26]. Additionally, our previous work [27] demonstrated
that alternative methods, such as the hydrothermal method, are
impractical for EPO reaction applications. This is attributed to the use of

the pump liner were constructed from inert materials such as plastic or
Teflon, and they underwent meticulous cleaning with 37% nitric acid,
followed by thorough rinsing with deionized water between sample
analyses.
Chemisorption experiments were conducted involving the titration
of hydrogen (H2) on a silver surface previously covered with oxygen
(O2). The experiments utilized a Micromeritics 2920 pulsed chemi-
sorption analyzer, following a procedure outlined in the literature [35].
The sample preparation involved the reduction of silver samples for
2hours at 280◦C in a gas mixture containing 10% H2 and the remainder
Ar. Subsequently, the samples were cooled to 180◦C and purged with
flowing Ar for 30minutes to remove H2. Afterward, they were exposed
to a gas mixture consisting of 10% O2 balanced with He for 30minutes
to saturate the silver surface with oxygen. Ar flowed for 30minutes to
remove the extra gaseous oxygen. The pulsed H2 titration was then
conducted at 170◦C. The ratio of oxygen pre-covered silver surface to
hydrogen was set at 1:1. Each sample underwent an additional sequence
of H2 titration, and the results are reported as an average.
The reactor employed a 3/8” stainless steel tube housing 1g of
α-Al2O3-supported catalyst powder, with temperature monitored using a
K-type thermocouple positioned within the catalyst bed. The experi-

Ethylene in Nitrogen, another with Pure Oxygen, and the third with Pure
Nitrogen (All gases were of UHP purity grade, with most purchased from
Airgas, except for the ethylene/nitrogen mixture, which was obtained
from Praxair). For experimental runs, the feed compositions were
adjusted to maintain a constant 10% ethylene concentration while
varying the oxygen concentration to achieve 10%, 30%, and 50%
levels. This was achieved by adjusting the flow rates of nitrogen and
oxygen while keeping the ethylene flow rate constant. Throughout these
experiments, the total flow rate was consistently set at 20 sccm. Effluent Fig. 3. (a) SEM image of unsupported silver nanowires (AgNWs) synthesized

using water as a solvent resulted in nanowires sticking to each other
rather than to the support [28].
Silver spherical particles were synthesized using wet impregnation
methods, employing two different silver precursors and sets of solvents
to produce particles of two different sizes. Using silver nitrate and DI
water as the silver precursor and solvent would not result in a narrow
distribution and small particles, as shown in the references used for
synthesis [6,38,39]. Therefore, the spherical particles synthesized using
silver nitrate and DI water via wet impregnation in this study are
referred to as larger silver spherical particles. In Fig. 6(a) and (b), SEM
images depict larger silver spherical catalysts supported on α-Al2O3,
along with a histogram illustrating the diameter distribution. The

illustrates the morphology of silver nanowires after impregnation onto

of the support. Importantly, the overall morphology of the nanowires
remains unchanged following sonication, drying, and mild stirring. ICP
analysis revealed approximately 5wt% of silver on the support, indi-
cating significant loss of silver during the preparation process. This
waste could occur at various stages, such as during nanowire synthesis,
where some nanowires may adhere to the bottom of the round-neck
flask, during centrifugation, where any potential synthesized spherical
particles are separated from the nanowires, and during impregnation,
where a small portion of nanowires may stick to the beaker. The use of
ethanol as a solvent for impregnating silver nanowires onto the support
is deemed essential for preserving their structure [22,24]. Although
investigating the scientific reasons for using ethanol as a solvent was
beyond the scope of this study, our previous research has shown that

performed during pretreatment, as reducing conditions could poten-

similar function in enhancing EO selectivity even if oxidized into CsO
[14]. Increasing the oxygen partial pressure resulted in a corresponding
increase in EO selectivity, mirroring the behavior observed with
unpromoted silver catalysts. The trend of increasing EO selectivity with
promoted AgNWs was comparable to that of the unpromoted catalysts.
Cesium is believed to enhance EO selectivity by inducing dipole mo-
ments, reducing the energy barrier for O2 dissociation, and stabilizing
intermediates for EO formation, as discussed previously [14–17].

this are essential for isolating the intrinsic properties of the catalysts.
Therefore, incorporating Cl into the AgNWs, in conjunction with the use
of 10wt% AgNWs, could potentially lead to even greater improvements
in EO selectivity than those reported in Table 2. These results underscore
the high EO selectivity of Cs-promoted AgNWs, suggesting that further
enhancement may be possible through Cl addition and increased silver
loading in future studies.
One unexplored aspect in the existing literature pertaining to ex-
periments conducted on the (100) facets of silver involves the investi-
gation of time-on-stream stability. In particular, the ethylene
epoxidation reaction necessitates a relatively extended period at the
onset of the run to achieve a stable state. Numerous studies on spherical
silver catalysts have reported a time frame of 24–72hours for this re-
action to attain stability [8,18,22,40]. Fig. 13illustrates the EO selec-
tivity for unpromoted silver nanowires from the initiation up to 48hours
of continuous operation. Notably, the EO selectivity stabilizes after
approximately 10–15hours, considerably lower than the 24–72hours
required for spherical catalysts to achieve stability, as mentioned in the
literature. Moreover, the EO selectivity of AgNWs after reaching the
