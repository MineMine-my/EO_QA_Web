Abstract
Copper–silver bimetallic catalysts offer improved selectivity relative to silver in the direct epoxidation of ethylene, as predicted by density
functional theory calculations. The performance advantages of bimetallics over silver have been shown previously for unpromoted, monolith-
supportedcatalysts.HerewedemonstratethatthehigheractivityandselectivityofCu–Agbimetalliccatalystspreparedbysequentialimpregnation
are maintained when conventional promoters, such as cesium and/or chlorine, are used. Selectivities to ethylene oxide obtained for promoted
