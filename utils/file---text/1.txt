lic catalysts outperformed the pure silver catalysts even under
the most oxygen-rich conditions, in which the propensity for
combustion should be enhanced. The ability of copper to act
as a total oxidation catalyst may lead to the potential for di-
minished performance of the bimetallic catalysts under severe
oxidizing conditions. However, there did not appear to be any
significant loss of performance relative to pure silver for the
conditions studied. Maximum selectivities to EO of 55–56%
were observed for the 0.2–1.0% Cu–Ag bimetallic catalysts
