The experimental and calculation results showed that oxygen molecules were activated on the Ag catalyst surface
to form 1O2 and •O2 – species. These species then migrated onto the SiC with the ethylene adsorbed on the SiC
surface. The oxygen vacancies in CeO2 promote the migration of these oxygen species, and thus enhance the
reaction performance.

powder was purified in a mixture composed of HF and HCl to remove
any possible impurities. After the washing, the powders were rinsed
until neutral and dried. The CeO2 modification was described as follows.
1.9 g washed SiC was dispersed in 50 mL anhydrous ethanol, followed
by addition of the Ce(NO3)3 ⋅6H2O solution (0.116 M). After stirring for
3 h, the ethanol and water in the mixture were removed by vacuum
rotary evaporation. Subsequently, heat treatment was carried out in a
muffle furnace at 500 ◦C for 4 h. The obtained sample was named as 5 %
CeO2-SiC, in which the CeO2 modification amount was 5 wt%. Similarly,
different CeO2-modified carriers were prepared by varying the amount
of Ce(NO3)3 ⋅6H2O, and named as x%CeO2-SiC (x =3, 5, 7, 10). The Ag/
CeO2-SiC catalysts with 15 wt% Ag loading were prepared by the
method reported previously [27], and the catalysts were named Ag/x%
CeO2-SiC (x =3, 5, 7, 10).
2.2. Catalyst test
The reaction was carried out in a tubular fixed bed reactor (i.d. =6
mm) with a length of 200 mm. The Ag/x%CeO2-SiC catalyst was shaped
into tablets and subsequently crushed into 10–20 mesh particles. 2 mL of

on SiC. 1O2 and •O2 – were formed on the Ag surface and then migrated to
the SiC surface, where they react with ethylene adsorbed on the SiC. The
Vo in CeO2 can promote the spillover of these oxygen species, ultimately
enhancing the reaction performance. This work provides new perspec-
tives for a deeper understanding of ethylene epoxidation reactions and
contributes to the development of catalysts for epoxidation.
