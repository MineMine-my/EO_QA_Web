turnover frequency for the smaller particles.
Also, the disparity in conversion trends between the
catalysts calcined for 2 and 12 h can be explained by the
difference intheparticlesizedistributionsforthedifferent
calcination times. By reducing sintering, the 2 h catalysts
undergo increases in surface area while maintaining an
almost constant particle size distribution eliminating the
tradeoff seen for the 12 h calcined samples. Therefore,
