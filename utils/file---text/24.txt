A mixed oxide of silver and nickel AgNiO was obtained via co-precipitation in alkaline medium. This
2
oxide demonstrates room temperature activity in the reaction of ethylene epoxidation with a high
selectivity(upto70%).UsingthePDFmethod,itwasfoundthattheinitialstructureofAgNiO contains
2
stacking faults and silver vacancies, which cause the nonstoichiometry of the oxide (Ag/Ni o 1). It has
been established that on the initial surface of AgNiO oxide, silver state can be considered as an 2
intermediate between Ag O and Ag0 (i.e. Agd+-like), while nickel is characterized by signs of a deeply
2
oxidized state (Ni3+-like). The interaction of AgNiO with C H at room temperature leads to the
