Cesium (Cs) is a key promoter to improve the selectivity of Ag catalyst for ethylene epoxidation. However,
there is still no consensus in the literature about the origin of enhanced ethylene oxide (EO) electivity
by Cs-promoted Ag catalysts. In this paper, the role of Cs as a promoter for ethylene epoxidation on
Ag catalyst is studied by both experiments conducted under industrially relevant conditions as well as
density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Ag/(cid:2)-Al2O3 and Ag-Cs/(cid:2)-Al2O3 catalyst are prepared by
excessive impregnation and evaluated for ethylene epoxidation to determine the mechanism of selectiv-
ity enhancement for Ag catalysts that contain Cs. With the optimal loading of Cs, Ag particles of uniform
size are evenly distributed on the support and EO selectivity increases from approximately 72.5%–82.0%
compared with the Ag/(cid:2)-Al2O3. O2-TPD results indicate that Cs decreases the adsorption strength of oxy-
gen on Ag and XPS analyses show that Cs shifts the Ag 3d binding 5/2 energy to facilitate the desorption of
the EO precursor to form gas EO. DFT calculations demonstrate that Cs-promotor can weaken the adsorp-
tion of atomic oxygen. Electron density of atom oxygen absorbed on silver decreases with the addition of
Cs on Ag(111) thereby enhancing the electrophilic attack by atomic oxygen at the electron-rich C C bond
of C2H4. Therefore, Cs lowers the activation energy for the formation of the oxometallacycle (OMC) and
EO, while increasing the barrier for acetaldehyde (AA) formation, thereby leading to higher EO selectivity.

1. Introduction
Ethylene oxide (EO) serves as a key chemical intermediate which
is produced more than 27 Mt/y on the world-wide by the year 2017
[1] and about 70% of EO is converted to ethylene glycol (EG) by
hydration. EG is one of the most important chemicals from which
further products such as polyester, plastics, and engine antifreeze
can be derived [2]. Direct oxidation of ethylene to EO in the pres-
ence of supported Ag catalysts has emerged as the main route for
EO production since Lefort discovered the process in 1931 [3]. The
competing parallel reactions are as shown below [4], where r1
represents the desired, mildly exothermic and selective pathway
leading to the formation of EO. Alternatively, ethylene and/or EO
can undergo combustion to CO and

through one or both of two

that of main reaction. Hence, it is of great significance for industrial
production to increase EO selectivity to avoid thermal runaway, cut
the cost and increase profit [5].

So far, silver is the most efficient catalyst for ethylene epox-
idation [6]. Numerous papers and patents have reported various
of ways to increase ethylene oxide (EO) selectivity [7–11], includ-
ing the usage of different silver precursors, different preparation
techniques, and promoters. Among them, the use of Cs as a selectiv-
ity promoter has been discussed at length. Lambert and coworkers
argued that Cs can decrease the binding strength between EO and
the catalyst surface [12], thereby minimizing sequential reaction
to form carbon dioxide. It has been reported that the presence of

cesium would neutralize the acid sites on support, avoiding the
isomerization of EO to form acetaldehyde (AA), which finally trans-
form to CO and
2
H O

[13]. Cs has also been shown to favor the
formation of strongly adsorbed electrophilic oxygen to form EO
[14]. Moreover, it has been suggested that cesium plays a key role
in binding and dispersing the silver particles on the support [15].
Linic and Barteau [16] demonstrated that a surface intermediate
oxometallacycle (OMC) could be formed through the ring-closure
reaction of weakly absorbed ethylene with adsorbed oxygen, and
then the OMC intermediate reacted through a transition state to
form EO and AA [17,18]. Though the mechanism of ethylene epox-
idation changes slightly with the coverage of oxygen [19,20], the
OMC is an important intermediate in the process of ethylene epox-
idation. Saravanan [21] found that Cs was an electron donor for
the OMC and the presence of Cs atom repelled the OMC intermedi-
ate. Linic et al. [22] suggested that Cs cations increase the selectivity
by long-range electrostatic interactions that stabilize the transition
state for the EO formation. Ozbek et al. [23] performed computa-
tional studies on an Ag O(001) 2 and found that the presence of Cs
resulted in the formation of CsOx complexes and introduced the
surface oxygen vacancies, which could reduce the catalyst selec-
tivity. It is also found that Cs and Cl co-existed on the surface can
result in high EO selectivity. Though many theoretical studies about
the ethylene epoxidation on different silver surfaces have been
developed [24,25], investigations on the reaction mechanism on Cs
promoted Ag catalysts using Density functional theory (DFT) cal-
culations are still relatively little. Furthermore, the experimental
results of most literature were concluded on single crystal silver
catalysts or under rigor reaction conditions inconsistent with the
industrial process. Therefore, the specific role of promoter Cs in the
selective oxidation of ethylene is still the subject of considerable
debate.
In this work, we explored the role of Cs as a promoter for
Ag catalyst through the analysis of ethylene epoxidation on un-
promoted and optimal loading Cs-promoted Ag catalyst in both
experiments conducted under industrially relevant conditions as
well as DFT calculations. According to the previous experimen-
tal studies [26,27], addition of ppm levels of 1,2-dichloroethane
(DCE) can promote catalyst selectivity, therefore, all the experi-
ments were concluded under 0.3 ppm DCE. It was demonstrated
that Cs decreased the binding energy of Ag 3d ,
5/2
which facilitated
desorption of the produced intermediate to form EO. With the com-
bination of DFT calculations performed on pure and Cs-promoted
Ag(111), we study the origin of enhanced ethylene epoxidation
selectivity derived from Cs-promotor by analyzing the electronic
distribution of the adsorbed oxygen and intermediate(OMC), and
the activation energy along the reaction path. DFT calculations
demonstrate that the presence of Cs increased the electrophilic
oxygen adsorbed on Ag surface, which lowered the activation
energy to form oxometallacycle (OMC) and EO, meanwhile increas-
ing the barrier toward acetaldehyde (AA).
2. Material and methods
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The Ag/(cid:2)-Al O and
2 3
Ag-Cs/(cid:2)-Al O catalysts
2 3
in this inves-
tigation were prepared using excessive impregnation method
according to the patent literature [28]. The Ag C O was
2 2 4
slowly
dissolved into an aqueous solution containing a 3:1 M ratio
of ethylene-diamine (EN) to Ag C O ,
2 2 4
and then the Ag C O -
2 2 4
containing impregnation solution was added to the support, then
the sample was heated to 300–400◦C for thermal decomposition
under air atmosphere for ten minutes. The Ag-Cs/(cid:2)-Al O catalyst
2 3
was prepared using the same procedure with
lyst
Ag/(cid:2)-Al O cata-
2 3
as mentioned above. Catalysts with different Cs contents were
obtained by adding different amounts of CsOH solution into the
Ag C O -containing
2 2 4
impregnation solution. Ag loadings of all these
catalysts maintained 15 wt%.
2.2. Catalyst evaluation
Catalysts were evaluated in a stainless steel reactor with
4 mm inner diameter. The catalysts were broken and sieved to
0.9–1.4 mm, then 1 ml sample was loaded into the reactor. Quanti-
tative analysis of inlet and outlet gas composition was performed
on an online Prima dB mass spectrum produced by Thermo Scien-
tific. The gas was ionized by bombardment of electron current in
ion source. Stand Faraday detector was used to analyze the gas con-
centration of 10 ppm–100%, and the concentration between 10 ppb
to 10 ppm was detected by secondary electron multiplier. Gas feed
composition was C H 30%,
2 4
O 7.5%,

CO 1.85%,

ethylene dichlo-
ride (EDC) 0.1–0.5 ppm, balance N at
2
1.7 MPa total pressure, and
the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 5000 h−1. Temperature was
recorded when EO concentration of outlet gas stream attained at
2.5 mol%. The EO selectivity was expressed as the following equa-
tion.

Since ethylene oxide molecules are easily converted to carbon
dioxide and water in pores with such small diameters as nanometer
order, it is realized that pore diameter of carriers should be as close
as possible to a desired macropore size. The surface area of (cid:2)-Al O 2 3
carrier is about 1.0 m2/g, and the average pore diameter of (cid:2)-Al O 2 3
carrier is about 1.0 (cid:3)m [29]. We approximately calculated the effect
of mass transfer according to the Weisz-Prater criterion (see details
in the Supporting Information). It is noted that the value of Nw-pis
0.0044, which is much less than 0.3. It indicates that pore diffu-
sion can be excluded. So the value of catalyst effectiveness factor
(cid:4) should be approximately to be 1.0. In addition, the experimen-
tal results proved that no mass transfer effect exists for ethylene
epoxidation with our evaluation conditions.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
O -TPD 2 was measured using a TPDRO 1100 automated
chemisorption analyzer with a Pfeiffer Vacuum Quadrupole Mass
Spectrometer. 2.0 g of catalysts was exposed to 30 ml/min He for
1 h, then temperature was increased to 550◦C and kept for 1 h to
remove the impurities on the sample. After the catalyst was cooled
to 210◦C in He, O was 2 switched to chemisorb on catalyst for 1 h
and then the sample was cooled to room temperature in He. As the
baseline was stable, the catalyst was analyzed with temperature-
programmed desorption from room to 550◦C.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs were col-
lected using a FEI Quanta200 Scanning Electron Microscope with
a tungsten electron source and three imaging modes (high vac-
uum, low vacuum and ESEM) to accommodate the widest range
of samples for any SEM system. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS)
was carried out with a Thermo Scientific 250 ESCALAB, the sys-
tem is equipped with an X-ray source to produce Al K(cid:2) radiation
for XPS measurements, and the A12p line being used with a bind-
ing energy of 74.5 eV;XRD measurement was performed using a
Empyrean X-ray diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 40 mA using
Cu K(cid:2) radiation, scanning range: 8–100◦and Scanning rate: 0.65◦/s.
2.4. DFT calculations
DFT calculations were performed using the PWSCF (Plane-Wave
Self-Consistent Field) code in the Quantum ESPRESSO package. Gra-

dient corrections are included using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerh
form of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The kinetic
energy cutoff for the selection of the plane-wave basis set is fixed to
40 Ry. The regular Ag(111) surface was modeled with a five-layer
slab, each layer contains either 9 Ag atoms (3 × 3cell), oxygen atom
was absorbed on the upper Ag layer and the bottom three layers of
the slab are kept fixed during structural optimizations. For calcula-
tions of the electronic properties of Ag(111) slab, Monkhorst-Pack
4 × 4 × 1 k-points with 16 k-points were used. The geometry opti-
mizations stop when the maximum force on the atoms is less than
10−4a.u. The climbing-image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method
is used to determine the minimum-energy pathway for elementary
reaction steps for ethylene epoxidation.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Effect of promoter Cs on the performance of silver catalyst
The results of evaluation shown in Fig. 1 indicated that the
reaction temperature gradually enhance as increasing of the Cs
loadings, and that elevated rapidly when cesium loading was
above 1000 ppm. EO selectivity increased with Cs loadings rising
to 800 ppm, while higher amount of Cs resulted in the decreasing
of EO selectivity, Optimum alkali promotion was achieved when
a little of Cs was used, and further increasing the alkali coverage
reduced catalyst activity and selectivity, which is in good agree-
ment with the previous work [30]. The optimal Cs loadings ranged
from approximately 600–800 ppm, on which EO selectivity was
about 82.0% and reaction temperature was approximately 220◦C.
Reaction temperature on catalyst without Cs was 209◦C, and EO
selectivity was 72.5%, enhancing approximately 10% because of the
addition of proper amount of Cs.
The addition of Cs has a negative influence on the activity of sil-
ver catalyst, which is in good agreement with the study reported by
Barteau [31] who demonstronted that the catalyst activity is sen-
sitive to alkali metal loading, and it suppress all activity by adding
larger amounts of alkalis. However, the optimal Cs loading was dif-
ferent from the result reported by Diao et al. [4], who suggested
that the best quantity of Cs is 300–450 ppm. The optimal loading
of promoter Cs is influenced by varied (cid:2)-Al O carriers 2 3 used in the
catatlyst and the silver concent loaded on

them.
Effect of Cs on size and distribution of silver particles

The massive and flat
regions depicts the crystal plates of (cid:2)-Al O carrier,
2 3
and the smaller
white particles are the supported Ag particles. It can be seen from
picture (a) that the size of Ag particles in 15%Ag/(cid:2)-Al O catalyst
2 3
are not uniform. The diameter of the large grains are more than
100 nm while the small ones are less than 50 nm. Large particles are
mainly distributed on the margin of the carrier, while smaller par-
ticles are distributed on the surface of the carrier. Crystal plates are
partially exposed, which would result in the decrease of EO selectiv-
ity because the weak acidity of (cid:2)-Al O led
2 3
to complete oxidation
of ethylene [32]. However, in the presence of Cs, Ag appears to wet
the (cid:2)-Al O surface
2 3
and Ag particles are evenly in size and dis-
tribute uniformly on the crystal plate of the support [15,33], which
benefits the catalytic performance of silver catalyst [34].

characterization
The oxygen species held on a 15%Ag/(cid:2)-Al O and
2 3
15%Ag-
600ppmCs/(cid:2)-Al O catalysts
2 3
were studied by temperature pro-
grammed desorption (O -TPD),
2
without considering of oxygen
adsorbed on the (cid:2)-Al O support
2 3
[14], as presented in Fig. 3. There
are two peaks for desorbed oxygen in both catalysts, corresponding
to the Ag-O bonds of different bond strengths [35]. The tem-
peratures for different oxygen species desorption are 275◦C and
320◦C in Ag/(cid:2)-Al O ,
2 3
respectively. In contrast, the temperatures
are 270◦C and 305◦C in Ag-Cs/(cid:2)-Al O ,
2 3
respectively. The results
are consistent with the previous work by Couves [36]. Our results
show that oxygen desorbs from the silver catalysts in two states
with different desorption temperatures, corresponding to oxygen
desorbing from Ag(111) and from a highly stepped or defected Ag
surfaces, respectively, in which EO and CO produced
2
coincidently.
From Fig. 3, we can also conclude that the maximum desorption
temperature declines in different degree by the addition of Cs. The
desorption temperature of strong Ag-O bond decreases about 15◦C
while that of weak Ag-O bond reduces about 5◦C. The concentration
of strongly adsorbed oxygen decreases and that of weakly adsorbed
oxygen has no obvious change, resulting in the decreasing of total
amounts of adsorbed oxygen. Addition of Cs decreases the intensity

of Ag-O bond and the concentration of strongly adsorbed oxygen,
which resulted in the increase of reaction temperature and higher
selectivity for ethylene epoxidation reaction.
3.4. XPS characterization
In order to better explore possible electronic interactions
between Ag and Cs, XPS studies were conducted on 15%Ag/(cid:2)-Al O
2 3
and 15%Ag–600 ppm Cs/(cid:2)-Al O catalysts.

The XPS results in Fig. 4
show us the Ag 3d binding

energies of silver catalysts. The bind-
ing energy (BE) of Ag 3d is

367.7 eV for Ag/(cid:2)-Al O ,
2 3
while it is
367.6 eV for Ag-Cs/(cid:2)-Al O catalyst.
2 3
The addition of Cs lowers the
BE value by 0.1 eV suggesting the transfer of e− from the highly
polarizable Cs+to metallic Ag, which is consistent with earlier result
from Monnier et al. [37]. Higher charge and lower binding energy
of Ag would result in desorption of the EO precursor to form gas
EO. The result is in good agreement with the view from Diao et al.
[4], who suggested that promoter Cs reduced the binding energy of
Ag and the activation energy from EO precursor to gas EO, avoding
further oxidation to form CO ,

enhancing the selectivity of EO.

Ag(111), Ag(100) and Ag (110) are in 38.1◦, 44.4◦ and 64.8◦ of 2(cid:5)

The strength of the peak assigned to Ag(111) is maximum,
the sequent is Ag(100) and the Ag(110) surface is minimum, as lit-
erature has reported that major metallic Ag exists stably in the form
of Ag(111) in silver catalysts [38]. Therefore, ethylene epoxidation
was mainly calculated on the surface of Ag(111) in next section.

3.6. DFT calculations
In order to unveil the origin of Cs enhanced catalytic selec-
tivity of silver catalyst for ethylene epoxidation, we employed
density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the
differences of oxygen adsorption and the activation barrier for
ethylene oxide formation between pure Ag(111) and Cs-promoted
Ag(111) surface. According to the proposed mechanism, oxomet-
allacycle (OMC) intermediate is formed through the reaction of
weakly absorbed ethylene reacts with adsorbed oxygen and then
it is converted into EO and AA through ethylene epoxidation and
complete combustion, respectively, and the elementary reactions
are shown below:
O ∗

R1: C H ∗
2 4
+ O∗→ OMC∗
R2: O MC∗→ C H O∗(EO)
2 4
R3: OMC∗→ CH CHO∗(AA) 3
As molecular oxygen decomposed to form atomic oxygen
rapidly on Ag surface [39,40], the O dissociation
2
is not considered
in this paper. So the possible rate-determining steps may include
weakly absorbed ethylene reacting with binding oxygen to form
OMC (R1) and OMC reacting through ring closure or H-transfer to
produce absorbed EO (R2) or AA (R3) [6,18,41].
To search for the minimum energy profiles (MEP) for the ethy-
lene epoxidation, we have optimized the adsorption configuration
of reactant, intermediate and product on catalysis. Top, bridge,
fcc and hcp hollow sites are the four sites for oxygen adsorbed
on Ag(111) [21], which are shown in Fig. 6a and the fcc has the
strongest oxygen adsorption energy [38]. Suljo [22] observed

the positive impact of Cs on the selectivity drops off with the dis-
tance between Cs and the EO transition increasing. In general, the
closer the distance of atomic Cs to oxygen adsorbed on Ag, the
higher the selectivity of EO. So cationic Cs is located at the hol-
low site of Ag(111) and is nearby the binding atomic oxygen at fcc
sites in this work. Meanwhile, the preferred ethylene adsorption
position is at the top site with a hexagonal empty space around
[38]. Fig. 6 shows the platform of adsorbed atomic oxygen and
co-adsorbed of O and C H on 2 4 Ag(111) and Cs-Ag(111).
As shown in Table 1, the adsorption energy of oxygen is 5.92 eV
on clean Ag(111), while it is 5.22 eV on Cs-Ag(111) surface. Addi-
tion of Cs reduces the adsorption energy but increases the bond
length of Ag-O from 2.18 to 2.26 Å. Saravanan et al. [21] using Ag
10
clusters model demonstrates that the binding energy of oxygen on
Ag(111) is 3.21 eV, the length of Ag-O bond is 1.46 Å, and those are
2.71 eV and 3.21 Å on Cs-Ag(111) surface, respectively. Though the
changes are similar in binding energy of oxygen and bond length
by Cs promotion, large differences exist in calculation results by
different models. Meanwhile, the reduced electron number from
0.44 to 0.26 |e| of adsorbed oxygen by the addition of Cs shows
weakly adsorbed oxygen, which is benefit for the formation of the
EO [16–18].

In order to demonstrate the role of weakly adsorbed atomic
oxygen played in the enhancement of catalytic selectivity of ethy-
lene epoxidation, a series of detailed electronic structure analysis
is performed. Fig. 7 shows the highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO) of the studied structures around the atomic oxygens
absorbed on surface, indicating that atomic oxygen is the electron
donation center in reaction. Comparing Fig. 7a with b, it is found
that region of HOMO of atomic oxygen shrinks with the addition of
Cs, mutually corroborating the decreasing excess electron number
of atomic oxygen in Table 1. Strongly binding oxygen with higher
electron density on Ag(111) shows nucleophilic property relative to
that on Cs-Ag(111), and tends to attach the C H bond in C H with
2 4
low electron density, facilitating the formation of AA. Oppositely,
the weakly adsorbed oxygen with lower electron density on Cs-
Ag(111) is regarded as electrophilic center, which prefers to react
with ethylene to form EO by attacking C C bond, because of the
high electron density located in (cid:6) bond of C C bond. Fig. 8 shows
the local density of state (LDOS) for C C bond of OMC intermedi-
ate formed in the reaction between ethylene and atomic oxygen
(R1) on Ag(111) and Cs-Ag(111). As known to all, the difference in
the bond strength derives from the anti-bonding states, that is, the
antibonding states move to lower energy level and become higher
occupancy, which leads to a weaker bond, and vice versa. In the
process of the OMC formation, the antibonding orbital (cid:6)* in C C
bond moves below the Fermi energy furtherly on Cs-Ag(111) com-
pared with pure Ag(111), so the stability of C C bond is weaker on
Cs-Ag(111) than that on pure Ag(111) surface, which makes atomic
oxygen easily insert the C C bond to form the target product EO on
Cs-Ag(111).
Fig. 9 shows the optimized configurations along the minimum
energy profiles and activation energies for all elementary steps.
From Fig. 9 and Table 2, we can draw that the activation energy
is 0.47 eV on Ag(111) surface while it is 0.39 eV on Cs-Ag(111)
surface in the formation of the OMC intermediate. The activation
energies are 0.72 and 0.73 eV from OMC to EO and AA on Ag(111)
surface, respectively, and the same reactions occur on the surface

Cs-Ag(111), in which the activation energies are 0.57 and 0.78 eV,
respectively. The difference in the activation barrier for AA and EO
formation calculated on Ag(111) is 0.1 eV, while the value is 0.21 eV
on Cs-promoted Ag(111). The similar activation barriers result in
the lower EO selectivity [42], but the lower activation energy to
produce EO and the higher barrier to form AA can enhance the selec-
tivity from the OMC intermediate to EO. The energy difference of
the activation barrier from OMC to EO and AA is much more one on

Ag(111) and (b) Cs-Ag(111).
Cs-Ag(111) (0.21 eV) than that on Ag(111) surface (0.01 eV), which
implies a higher selectivity to EO [6,22].
In addition, as shown in Table 2, the adsorption strength of EO
on Cs-Ag(111) surface (-0.24 eV) is weaker than that on Ag(111)
surface (−0.46 eV), indicating that the addition of promoter Cs
promotes the desorption adsorbed EO to free EO and furtherly
increases the selectivity toward EO.
The DFT calculations demonstrate that Cs-promotor can weaken
the adsorption strength of atomic oxygen, which is shown to be
in good agreement with experimental observations of O -TPD. 2
Weakly adsorbed atomic oxygen attributes to the introduction of
Cs, which lowers the activation energy to form OMC and EO, mean-
while increases the barrier toward acetaldehyde (AA). Besides, XPS
analyses show that Cs shifts the Ag 3d binding 5/2 energy to facilitate
desorption of the EO precursor to form gas EO, which is also con-
sistent with DFT results that Cs decreases the adsorption energy
of EO. Therefore, our combined experimental and computational
studies uncover the origin of enhanced ethylene oxide selectivity
on Cs-promoted Ag catalyst.
4. Conclusions
In this paper, the role of Cs as a promoter for ethylene epoxida-
tion on Ag catalyst is studied by both experiments conducted under
industrial conditions as well as density functional theory (DFT) cal-
culations. Ag/(cid:2)-Al O and 2 3 Ag-Cs/(cid:2)-Al O catalyst 2 3 were prepared
by excessive impregnation and evaluated for ethylene epoxida-
tion to determine the mechanism of selectivity enhancement for
Ag catalysts which contain Cs. The addition of Cs has a
influence
negative
on the activity of silver catalyst, the reaction tempera-
ture gradually enhanced as the increasing of Cs loadings. Optimal
Cs loading ranged from 600 to 800 ppm in 15%Ag/(cid:2)-Al O ,
2 3
on
which EO selectivity enhanced approximately 10% to reach 82.0%.
Promoter Cs maintained the proper size of Ag particles which ben-
efited the performance of silver catalysts and made Ag particles
distribute uniformly on the carrier, which improved the EO selec-
tivity by avoiding the complete combustion of ethylene. There are
two peaks of oxygen desorption for silver catalysts, and the addition
of Cs decreased the intensity of Ag-O bond and the concentration of
strongly adsorbed oxygen, which resulted in higher selectivity for
ethylene epoxidation reaction. Binding energy of Ag 3d reduced
5/2
from 367.7 to 367.6 eV when Cs promoter added to Ag/(cid:2)-Al O ,
2 3
which facilitated desorption of the EO precursor to form gas EO,
increasing the EO selectivity. Major metallic silver exists stably
in the form of Ag(111) in pure and Cs-promoted silver catalysts.
DFT calculations demonstrated that the addition of Cs reduced the
adsorption energy of oxygen and the electron numbers around oxy-
gen adsorbed on Ag(111) surface, but increased the length of Ag-O
bond. The low electron density of adsorbed oxygen on Cs-Ag(111)
easily reacted with the C C bond in ethylene to form OMC interme-
diate, which means that the activation energy for OMC formation
decreased on the surface of Cs-Ag(111). The activation energies for
OMC transforming to EO and AA were 0.72 and 0.73 eV on Ag(111)
surface, while that on Cs-Ag(111) were 0.57 and 0.78 eV, respec-
tively. The lower activation energy to produce EO and the higher
energy to form AA that resulted in the enhancing selectivity to EO.
