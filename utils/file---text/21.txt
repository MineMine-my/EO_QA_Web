To disclose the formation process of silver catalysts, we
employed CLSM equipped witha heating stage to in-situ observe
the thermal decomposition of silver precursor, as shown in the
videos of supporting information. Parts of the video were picked

shown in Fig. 3b, followed by the decomposition of silver salts

ments were conducted. TG curves were shown in Fig. 4, and the Fig.4. TGcurvesofsilvercatalystspreparedindifferentatmospheres.

two stages: (1) crystallizationprocess from room temperature to
80(cid:3)C,theweightlossinthisprocesswascontributedbytheevap-
oration of solvents; (2) the decomposition process from 80 (cid:3)C to
150(cid:3)C,duringwhichtheweightlosswasattributedtothedecom-
positionofthesilversaltprecursortoformsilverparticles.When
the silver precursor was heated in air, the weight loss given by
crystallization stopped at 49 (cid:3)C, which was lower than that in
nitrogen, as shown in Fig. 4. In the decomposition process, the
weight loss stopped at 124 (cid:3)C in air while the weight decreased
until 135 (cid:3)C in nitrogen. Both the crystallization and decomposi-
tion processes occurred at a lower temperature in air than that
in nitrogen. The following study would attempt to reveal this
difference.
