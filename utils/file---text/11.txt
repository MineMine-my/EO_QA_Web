∘ ∘ at 300 C for 1h, while the dried catalyst was dried at 150 C
overnight.
The SEM images (Figs2 and 3) displaying silver parti-
cles deposited on the alumina support clearly show that
calcination resulted in sintering. Figure4 shows a SEM
image of the dried catalyst after reaction and standard
pretreatment.
The size of the silver particles was measured with ImageJ
usinganin-housealgorithmtosegmentthesilverparticles.The
meansilverparticlesize,standarddeviationandnumberofpar-
ticles measured for the fresh and spent catalysts are listed in
Table2.
Contrary to the visual inspection of Figs2 and 3, Table2
states that the mean silver particle size for the fresh dried
catalyst is slightly larger than for the fresh calcined cata-
lyst. A possible reason for the larger particles on the dried
catalyst could be agglomeration of several small parti-
cles in the post-processing of the SEM images making it
difficult to separate individual particles before measuring
thesize.
