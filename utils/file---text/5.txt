EO selectivity also serve as active sites for EO secondary conversion. Thermal pretreatment (700 ◦C) for SiO2 support effectively
reduces hydrogen-bonded silanols via dehydration/condensation while retaining the silica’s porous architecture.
The resulting Ag/SiO2 catalyst features ultrasmall Ag nanoparticles (~3 nm) and demonstrates exceptional
performance of 81 % EO selectivity without requiring promoters. Furthermore, kinetic studies of the ethylene
oxidation reaction were conducted to investigate the impact of silanol species on reaction. This study provides
new insights into the influence of surface hydroxyls on ethylene epoxidation and offers a potential strategy for
optimizing catalyst performance through controlled surface modification.
