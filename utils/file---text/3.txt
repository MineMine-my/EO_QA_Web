The influence of different diluent gases (He, Ar, N2, CH4, and CH4balanced with He) on the epoxidation
of ethylene was comparatively studied over three different catalysts, including a commercial 14.86 wt.%
Ag/(cid:2)-Al2O3, a bimetallic 1.41 wt.% Cu–17.16 wt.% Ag/SrTiO3, and a 0.32 wt.% Sn-promoted on 1.39 wt.%
Cu–17.16 wt.% Ag/SrTiO3catalyst. The best diluent gas for ethylene epoxidation was CH4balanced with
He over all catalysts. CH4 enhanced C2H4 conversion while He provided both high EO selectivity and
yield. Thus, the 35% CH4balanced with 53% He diluent gas provided the highest synergistic effect toward
the ethylene epoxidation reaction, while also leading to the lowest level of coke formation.

1. Introduction
Ethylene oxide (EO) is an important intermediate in the
manufacture of several petrochemical products–ethylene glycol,
surfactants, anti-freezes, adhesives, explosives, lubricants, plasti-
cizers, and solvents [1–3]. EO is commercially produced through
the partial oxidation of ethylene using either air or oxygen over
Ag catalysts loaded on a low surface area (cid:2)-Al O support,
2 3
based
on the original work by Lefort in 1931 [4,5]. A generalized reaction
stoichiometry of the process is:

Apart from EO formation, by-products including CO, CO ,
2
and
H O 2 are simultaneously produced [6]. EO selectivity has been
improved by the use of different catalyst preparation techniques
[7–15], silver precursors [16–21], and promoters [22–24].

(Cs), as an alkali metal promoter, has been researched
extensively. The presence of Cs has been found to facilitate cover-
age of Ag on a support. Cs is mainly located in the subsurface region
with only a small amount at the catalyst surface [25]. This suggests
that Cs acts as a binder between the Ag and (cid:2)-Al O support
2 3
by cre-
ating and stabilizing interactions between the two phases. Grant
and Lambert [26] established that Cs neutralizes acid sites on the
oxide support that are responsible for isomerization of the epoxide
to acetaldehyde, followed by combustion. Cs also increases the con-
centration of crystalline lattice defects located in the electrophilic
oxygen area and decreases the amount of nucleophilic oxygen that
is involved in the total oxidation of ethylene.
Campbell [27] investigated the electronic effect of adding Cs
on Ag catalysts. The influence of Cs on Ag(1 1 1) was observed
and surface cesium oxide species (CsO ), 3 which existed in islands,
decomposed to form gaseous Cs and O at 2 610 K. Linic and Barteau
[28] stated that EO was produced through the formation of an
oxametallacycle intermediate (favoring the transition state). Thus,
the addition of a Cs promoter, which modified the electric field or
dipole–dipole interactions (electronic effect), resulted in a higher
transition state, causing more EO production. Epling et al. [29]
showed that there was a chemical interaction (electronic effect)
between Al, Cs, and Ag, which led to change in the electronic

properties of the Ag catalysts. Moreover, Yinsheng et al. [30]
compared the Ba and Cs promoting effects on a Ag surface,
which affected the ethylene epoxidation reaction. Ba was found
to increase activity in terms of conversion, but with slightly lower
EO selectivity. On the contrary, Cs enhanced EO selectivity, with
lower activity in terms of ethylene conversion.
In industrial practice, chlorine-containing compounds, i.e. 1,2-
dichloroethane (DCE), HCl, ethyl chloride, etc., are used as feed
additives to increase EO selectivity over Ag catalysts [22,27,31].
Conversely, the added chlorinated promoters on the surface of Ag
catalysts produce AgCl, which can poison the catalysts. To over-
come the poisoning problem by DCE, paraffins are added to the
feed. Compared with methane and ethylene, ethane is the most
effective dechlorinating agent.
Lafarga and Varma [32] investigated the effect of DCE addition
in the ethylene epoxidation reaction. EO selectivity increased to
greater than 80% but ethylene conversion decreased with increas-
ing DCE concentration in the feed (0–3.3 ppm). The deactivation
of the catalyst, for the highest level of DCE, was observed after a
few hours of reaction. Thus, ethane, at a relatively low concentra-
tion (ca. 1%), was added to the feed to moderate the deactivation
(controlling the amount of chlorine adsorbed on the catalyst sur-
face) to maximize the benefit of the DCE addition. The optimum
DCE level was 1–2 ppm, which gave the maximum EO yield with
highly stable activity. Recently, Dellamorte et al. [33] studied the
promotional effect of Re on Ag and Cu–Ag bimetallic catalysts for
the epoxidation of ethylene. The rhenium addition enhanced the
selectivity at small loadings with a large decrease in the catalytic
activity. The optimum rhenium loading for maximum EO selectiv-
ity was 25 ppm on the Ag catalyst and between 50 and 100 ppm on
the bimetallic Cu–Ag catalyst. The Re-promoted Ag catalysts had
more uniform distribution on the reaction sites for oxygen adsorp-
tion than the unpromoted ones, resulting in the enhancement of
EO selectivity. Moreover, the Re promoter might improve the EO
selectivity through the stabilization of defect regions or through
weakening of the Ag O bond.
Typical ethylene epoxidation processes are comprised of ethyl-
ene, oxygen, and diluent gas (balanced gas in the feed beyond the
reactant gases, C H and
2 4
O ,
2
so-called “third gas”) in the reactant
feed. Many researchers have used helium [16,34,35] or nitrogen
[3,36,37] as the diluent gas with various oxygen to ethylene ratios.
However, no systematic study of the effect of diluent gas on ethyl-
ene epoxidation activity has been reported in scientific literature.
From our previous work [38–40], the most promising cata-
lyst was the 0.32 wt.% Sn-promoted on 1.39 wt.% Cu–17.16 wt.%
Ag/SrTiO catalyst,
3
followed by the 1.41 wt.% Cu–17.16 wt.%
Ag/SrTiO catalyst.
3
In this part (Part IV of the study), the two cat-
alysts were employed in ethylene epoxidation experiments, and
compared to the 14.86 wt.% Ag/(cid:2)-Al O catalyst
2 3
(commercial cata-
lyst) with various diluent gases – He, Ar, N ,
2
CH ,
4
and CH balanced
4
with He. The optimum O to
2
C H molar
2 4
ratio and the most effective
diluent gas were investigated to identify the best reaction condi-
tions for the ethylene epoxidation reaction.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Silver nitrate (AgNO )
3
was purchased from S.R. Lab and (cid:2)-
Al O (0.109
2 3
m2/g) was purchased from Fluka. Tetraisopropyl
orthotitanate (TIPT; Ti(OCH(CH ) ) ),
3 2 4
strontium nitrate (Sr(NO ) ),
3 2
copper nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO ) ·3H O),
3 2 2
and laurylamine (LA,
CH (CH ) NH )
3 2 11 2
were supplied by Merck. Acetylacetone (ACA;
CH COCH COCH )
3 2 3
was obtained from S.D. Fine-Chemical. Tin chlo-
ride (SnCl )
2
was purchased from Aldrich. Hydrochloric acid
and
(HCl)
ethanol (C H OH)
2 5
were supplied by Labscan. All chemicals
used were of analytical grade and used as received without further
purification.
2.2. Catalyst preparation
A mesoporous-assembled SrTiO nanocrystal
3
support was syn-
thesized via a sol–gel process with the aid of a structure-directing
surfactant [38–40]. Briefly, ACA was first added to TIPT at an
equimolar ratio. In a separate beaker, the LA surfactant was dis-
solved with 0.5 ml of HCl and then added to a Sr(NO ) solution
3 2
containing a specific amount of Sr(NO ) and
3 2
ethanol to obtain the
Sr(NO ) /LA/HCl
3 2
solution. Next, this solution was poured into the
TIPT/ACA solution and continuously stirred. The resultant mixture
was incubated at 353 K for 4 d to obtain complete gel formation and
was further dried at 353 K for 4 d. Finally, the dried gel was calcined
at 923 K, which was the optimum support calcination temperature
identified in our previous work [39], to produce the mesoporous-
assembled nanocrystalline SrTiO support.
3
The Ag catalysts used in this work were prepared by incipi-
ent wetness impregnation using the (cid:2)-Al O and
2 3
SrTiO supports
3
with a silver nitrate solution to obtain nominal Ag loadings of
15 wt.% (actual Ag loading = 14.86 wt.%) and 17.5 wt.% (actual Ag
loading = 17.16 wt.%), respectively, which provided the best cat-
alytic performance for EO formation [38–40]. Then, the AgNO
3
precursor impregnated on the (cid:2)-Al O or
2 3
SrTiO support
3
was dried
at 383 K overnight and calcined at 773 K for 5 h to produce Ag/(cid:2)-
Al O and
2 3
Ag/SrTiO catalysts.
3
Next, the Ag/SrTiO catalyst
3
was
further impregnated with Cu(NO ) ·3H O
3 2 2
precursor to obtain a
nominal Cu loading of 1.5 wt.%. The catalyst sample was dried at
383 K overnight and then calcined in air at 773 K for 5 h to obtain
the bimetallic Cu–Ag catalyst.
The bimetallic Cu–Ag catalyst was promoted by tin using tin
chloride precursor with an optimum nominal tin loading of 0.4 wt.%
[40]. The mixture was first dried at 383 K overnight and finally cal-
cined at 673 K for 2 h to produce the 0.32 wt.% Sn-promoted on
1.39 wt.% Cu–17.16 wt.% Ag/SrTiO catalyst
3
[41].
2.3. Activity testing experiments

3
or 0.32 wt.% Sn-promoted on 1.39 wt.% Cu–17.16 wt.% Ag/SrTiO
3
catalyst was tested in a packed-bed 8-mm ID tubular reactor under
24.7 psia at 548 K [40] with various diluent gas systems. Initially,
30 mg of catalyst powder was packed in the reactor and pretreated
with oxygen at 473 K for 2 h. The feed gas was a mixture of 40% eth-
ylene in He, pure oxygen (HP grade), and a diluent gas (He, Ar, N ,
2
CH or
4
CH balanced
4
with He). The 6% ethylene and 3–7.5% oxygen
feed gases, with different diluent gas balances (He, Ar, N ,
2
CH or
4
CH balanced
4
with He), were regulated by using mass flow con-
trollers. The space velocity of the feed gas through the reactor was
maintained at 6000 h−1for all experimental runs. The composition
of the feed and effluent gases was analyzed by using an on-line gas
chromatograph (Perkin Elmer, ARNEL) equipped with a 60/80 CAR-
BOXEN 1 packed column (capable of separating carbon monoxide,
carbon dioxide, ethylene, and oxygen) and a Rt-U PLOT capillary
column (capable of separating EO, ethane, and propane). The forma-
tion of acetaldehyde was not detected under the studied conditions
because of further oxidation to carbon dioxide and water. Trace
amounts of acetaldehyde were formed, but were below the detec-
tion limit of the analytical system [42]. The catalytic activity of each
catalyst was compared at 6 h of operation. The experimental data,
with less than 5% error, were averaged to assess the catalytic per-
formance. Moreover, the catalysts, with different optimum diluent
gases, were operated for 72 h on stream to investigate long-term

stability and performance. Finally, the best catalyst (0.32 wt.% Sn-
promoted on 1.39 wt.% Cu–17.16 wt.% Ag/SrTiO )
3
was operated up
to 7 d (168 h) to observe the long-term stability and performance
of the ethylene epoxidation reaction.
2.4. Catalyst characterization
The N adsorption–desorption
2
isotherms of the catalysts were
obtained by using a surface area analyzer (Quantachrome, SAA-
1MP). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) approach was applied to
determine the specific surface areas using the adsorption data. The
actual metal loadings of the investigated catalysts were analyzed by
an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS; Varian, SpectrAA-
300).
The oxygen and ethylene uptake of the synthesized catalysts
was calculated from the desorption peaks that were obtained
by using a temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) analyzer
(Quantachrome, Chembet 3000). Oxygen (4.99% O in
2
He) or pure
ethylene (99.99% C H )
2 4
was initially adsorbed onto the catalyst sur-
face at 473 K for 2 h for the TPD experiments. The catalyst samples
were then cooled to room temperature in a high-purity He stream.
Next, the catalyst samples were heated from room temperature to
1173 K, with a heating rate of 10 K/min, and the desorbed gas was
swept by the high-purity He at a flow rate of 20 cm3/min. A thermal
conductivity detector (TCD) was used to measure the concentration
profile of the oxygen or ethylene in the effluent gas.
The surface morphology of the studied catalysts before and
after the reaction experiments, under optimum diluent gas system,
was characterized using a field emission scanning electron micro-
scope (FE-SEM; JEOL 5200-2AE). Prior to analysis, the samples were
coated with Pt to improve conductivity. Furthermore, the particle
size of loaded metals on the catalyst samples was examined by
transmission electron microscopes (TEM; JEOL 3011 at 300 kV; and
JEOL 2010 at 200 kV). The specimens for TEM analysis were pre-
pared by ultrasonically dispersing the catalyst powders in ethanol
and then placing drops of the suspension onto a grid coated with a
carbon film. The existence of Ag, Cu, and Sn particles on either the (cid:2)-
Al O or
2 3
SrTiO support
3
was verified by using an energy dispersive
X-ray spectroscope (EDS) attached to the TEM. The metal parti-
cle size was determined from measurements of multiple particles,
followed by statistical analysis of the TEM images.
The amount of coke deposited on the spent catalysts was
quantified by a thermogravimetric-differential thermal analyzer
(TG-DTA; PerkinElmer, Pyris Diamond).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterization results
The XRD and XPS results of the 14.86 wt.% Ag/(cid:2)-Al O com-
2 3
mercial catalyst were reported in Part I of the series [38]. The
XRD pattern revealed a highly crystalline structure of the SrTiO
3
support with dominant peaks of metallic Ag and a minor peak
of AgO. For the XPS results of the 14.86 wt.% Ag/(cid:2)-Al O catalyst,
2 3
the atomic ratio of Ag-to-Ag O
2
of 92.02%/7.98% before the reac-
tion was changed to 82.07%/17.93% after the reaction. The XRD
and XPS results of the other two catalysts (1.41 wt.% Cu–17.16 wt.%
Ag/SrTiO and
3
0.32 wt.% Sn-promoted on 1.39 wt.% Cu–17.16 wt.%
Ag/SrTiO )
3
were also reported in Part III of this series [40]. The
XRD patterns also clearly showed the highly crystalline structure
of the SrTiO support
3
with dominant peaks of metallic Ag and a
minor peak of AgO. The Cu second metal was also detected by XRD
in metallic form while the Sn promoter was not detected due to
an insignificant amount of Sn. The XPS results for the 1.41 wt.%
Cu–17.16 wt.% Ag/SrTiO catalyst
3
showed that the
Ag-to-Ag O
2
metallic
molar ratio changed from 11.5:1 before the reaction
to 5.4:1 after the reaction while the metallic Cu-to-CuO molar ratio
decreased from 14.9:1 before the reaction to 2.8:1 after the reac-
tion. For the 0.32 wt.% Sn-promoted on 1.39 wt.% Cu–17.16 wt.%
Ag/SrTiO catalyst,
3
the metallic Ag-to-Ag O
2
molar ratio decreased
from 14.4:1 before the reaction to 11.2:1 after the reaction, whereas
the metallic Cu-to-CuO molar ratio was changed from 15.7:1 before
the reaction to 10.6:1 after the reaction. It can be concluded that
an addition of the Cu second metal and/or Sn promoter can provide
higher metallic forms of both Ag and Cu, which, in turn, enhance
the ethylene epoxidation reaction in terms of high selectivity and
long-term stability [40].
3.1.1. Specific surface area results
The characterization results of all catalysts (14.86 wt.%
Ag/(cid:2)-Al O ,
2 3
1.41 wt.% Cu–17.16 wt.% Ag/SrTiO and
3
0.32 wt.%
Sn-promoted on 1.39 wt.% Cu–17.16 wt.% Ag/SrTiO catalysts),
3
including specific surface area, metal particle size, O uptake
2
and
C H uptake
2 4
are summarized in Table 1. All catalysts had extremely
low specific surface area, with the 14.86 wt.% Ag/(cid:2)-Al O cata-
2 3
lyst possessing the lowest specific surface area. The tin promoter
slightly decreased the specific surface area of the bimetallic Cu–Ag
catalyst.
3.1.2. TPD results
Table 1 also summarizes the adsorption capabilities of oxy-
gen, ethylene, and methane on the catalyst surfaces, in terms
of O ,
2
C H ,
2 4
and CH uptake.
4
The main oxygen and ethyl-
ene desorption peaks in the range of 400–700 K, together with
the main methane desorption peak at 325–600 K were used
to calculate the uptake results [40]. The highest amounts of
both the O and
2
C H uptake
2 4
were found on the 0.32 wt.% Sn-
promoted on 1.39 wt.% Cu–17.16 wt.% Ag/SrTiO catalyst,
3
followed
by the 1.41 wt.% Cu–17.16 wt.% Ag/SrTiO catalyst.
3
However, the
14.86 wt.% Ag/(cid:2)-Al O catalyst
2 3
only adsorbed an insignificant
amount of oxygen, while there was no measurable ethylene adsorp-
tion. Among the investigated catalysts, the 1.41 wt.% Cu–17.16 wt.%
Ag/SrTiO catalyst
3
had the highest methane uptake while the low-
est amount of the methane uptake was found on the 14.86 wt.%
Ag/(cid:2)-Al O catalyst.
2 3
The results indicate that the strong interac-
tion between Ag–Cu and the SrTiO support
3
greatly enhanced both
ethylene and oxygen uptake as compared to the weak interac-
tion between Ag and the (cid:2)-Al O support.
2 3
The addition of a small
amount of Sn promoter significantly increased both the ethylene
and oxygen uptake.
3.1.3. Surface morphology
The TEM/EDS technique was applied to verify the existence of
metal nanoparticles in the catalysts. The average catalyst particle
sizes are summarized in Table 1. Both promoted and unpromoted
bimetallic 1.41 wt.% Cu–17.16 wt.% Ag catalysts had larger Ag parti-
cle sizes (58 nm) than the 14.86 wt.% Ag/(cid:2)-Al O catalyst
2 3
(44 nm).
Moreover, the Sn-promoted on 1.39 wt.% Cu–17.16 wt.% Ag/SrTiO
3
catalyst possessed a slightly larger Cu particle size (5.5 nm) than
the unpromoted catalyst (4.7 nm). For the 0.32 wt.% Sn-promoted
on 1.39 wt.% Cu–17.16 wt.% Ag/SrTiO catalyst
3
operated at opti-
mum conditions with 6% O ,
2
6% C H and
2 4
35% CH balanced
4
with
53% He diluent gas, the average Ag particle size increased from
58 nm for the fresh catalyst to 60 nm for the post-reaction catalyst,
while the average Cu particle size increased from 5.5 to 5.8 nm,
and the average Sn particle size increased from 2.8 to 2.9 nm,
respectively. Moreover, for the 1.41 wt.% Cu–17.16 wt.% Ag/SrTiO
3
catalyst, the average Ag particle size increased from 58 nm for the
fresh catalyst to 61 nm for the post-reaction catalyst, while the
average Cu particle size increased from 4.7 to 5.8 nm after oper-
ating under optimum conditions (6% O ,

other hand, for the 14.86 wt.% Ag/(cid:2)-Al O catalyst,

the average Ag
particle size increased from 44 nm for the fresh catalyst to 49 nm
for the post-reaction catalyst after operating at optimum condi-
tions with 25% CH balanced

with 63% He diluent gas. The small
increases in the metal particle size of all catalysts after reaction
reveal that sintering or particle agglomeration was not of major
concern.

promoted on 1.39 wt.% Cu–17.16 wt.% Ag/SrTiO catalyst)

under
various diluent gas systems after the reaction, as compared to
the fresh catalyst, are illustrated in Fig. 1. There were no signifi-
cant changes in surface topologies after the reaction for all diluent
gas systems except for the system with 35% CH balanced
4
with
53% He, where a larger Ag particle size with a rounder shape was
observed. Fig. 2 compares the surface morphologies of the catalysts
that had been operated under optimum conditions with CH bal-
4
anced with He as diluent gases before and after the reaction. The
only catalyst that showed any significant change in surface mor-
phology was the 1.41 wt.% Cu–17.16 wt.% Ag/SrTiO catalyst,
3
where
surface agglomeration was observed after the reaction, resulting
in a smoother appearance with fewer attached particles (Fig. 2c
and d).
3.1.4. Coke formation
Table 2 summarizes the amount of coke formation on the
different post-reaction catalysts after carrying out the ethylene
epoxidation reaction for 6 and 72 h, respectively, with various dilu-
ent gas systems. The highest amount of coke formation was found
on the 14.86 wt.% Ag/(cid:2)-Al O catalyst 2 3 (6.4% at 6 h and 17.6% at 72 h)
with CH as
4
the diluent gas. The 0.32 wt.% Sn-promoted on 1.39 wt.%
Cu–17.16 wt.% Ag/SrTiO catalyst
3
possessed the lowest amount of
coke formation of 1.7% at 6 h (with He as the diluent gas) and 2.7%
at 72 h (with 35% CH balanced
4
with 53% He as the diluent gas),
followed by the 1.41 wt.% Cu–17.16 wt.% Ag/SrTiO catalyst
3
(2.4%
at 6 h and 4.0% at 72 h) with He as the diluent gas. The results show
that the addition of tin leads to a decrease in coke formation. For any
given catalyst, operation with diluent gas containing CH balanced 4
with He generally provided the lowest coke formation.

alyst provided the highest catalytic performance in terms of
yield,
EO
at 5.2%, and enhanced EO selectivity to 95.1%, and the best
long-term stability at 72 h on stream. Furthermore, the second
best catalyst was the 1.41 wt.% Cu–17.16 wt.% Ag/SrTiO catalyst.

Therefore, in this present work the two catalysts were studied as a
comparison to the commercial 14.86 wt.% Ag/(cid:2)-Al O catalyst.

The

and CH balanced

He) on ethylene epoxidation was compared to the effect of the He
diluent gas that was used in the previous work [38–40].

at 6 h on stream. The optimum O -to-C H
2 2 4
molar ratio of 1:1 (6% O and
2
6% C H )
2 4
provided the highest EO
selectivity and/or yield for all diluent gases, except for N with
2
an
optimum ratio of 0.75:1 (4.5% O and
2
6% C H ).

The He diluent sys-
tem had the highest EO selectivity in all investigated catalysts and
the maximum EO yield in some cases. However, the CH diluent
4
system provided the highest EO yield for the 14.86 wt.% Ag/(cid:2)-Al O
2 3
and the 1.41 wt.% Cu–17.16 wt.% Ag/SrTiO catalysts
3
at 6 h of oper-
ation. Hence, the CH gas
4
was mixed with He gas to investigate the
synergistic effect of the two diluent gases at different percentages
of CH to
4
obtain the optimum CH balance
4
with He for the three
catalysts. The ethylene epoxidation activity of the catalysts at 6
and 72 h on stream under different diluent gases is summarized in

4
was always low for all cases. The results can be used to correlate
the higher amount of coke formation in the CH diluent
4
system
as compared to the CH balanced
4
with He system (Table 2). CH
4
may help to increase the ethylene conversion, improve the activity
of the catalysts as well as suppress CO formation
2
[43] while He
simultaneously maintains high EO selectivity, resulting in syner-
gistic effects for EO formation. When CH was
4
completely replaced
by ethylene in the feed, the product was found to contain mainly
CO (the
2
data not shown here). This result illustrates that the
CH addition
4
can enhance the catalytic activity of the
epoxidation
ethylene
reaction only when a proper amount of CH is
4
added
to the He diluent gas.
The best diluent gas (CH balanced
4
with He) was next applied
in the long-term stability experiments of the catalysts, with the
results shown in Fig. 4. The catalytic activity of all catalysts declined
with time and reached a steady state at ∼50 h on stream. The
0.32 wt.% Sn-promoted on Cu–Ag/SrTiO was
3
found to be the most
effective catalyst, in which its EO selectivity slightly dropped from
99.5% at 6 h to 97% at 72 h and EO yield decreased from 5.5% to 5.1%.
The second best catalyst was the 1.41 wt.% Cu–17.16 wt.% Ag/SrTiO

catalyst where the EO selectivity decreased to 91% and EO yield to

5% after 72 h of operation. On the other hand, the 14.86 wt.% Ag/(cid:2)-
Al O catalyst
2 3
exhibited the worst long-term stability, providing an
EO selectivity of only 40% and EO yield of 1.3% after 72 h on stream.
The reason for the decline in catalytic activity of all catalysts was
mainly due to coke formation (see Table 2).
An ethylene epoxidation experiment to determine the best
catalyst (0.32 wt.% Sn-promoted on 1.39 wt.% Cu–17.16% wt.%
Ag/SrTiO )
3
was conducted for 7 days (168 h) to confirm the
long-term
superior
stability of this catalyst (Fig. 5). The EO selectivity
remained almost stable after 72 h on stream and slightly dropped
from 97% at 72 h to 96% at 168 h. The EO yield also depicted the
same trend, decreasing from 5.1% at 72 h to 4.9% at 168 h. The
good catalytic activity of this catalyst can be related to the rela-
tively high oxygen and ethylene adsorption capabilities and the
tin promoter, which prolongs stability of the ethylene epoxidation
reaction [40].

4. Conclusions
In this study, the effect of diluent gas on ethylene epoxidation
was investigated over the best catalyst (0.32 wt.% Sn-promoted on
1.39 wt.% Cu–17.16 wt.% Ag/SrTiO )
3
in comparison to the 1.41 wt.%
Cu–17.16 wt.% Ag/SrTiO catalyst
3
and a 14.86 wt.% Ag/(cid:2)-Al O
2 3
commercial catalyst. The type of diluent gas affected ethylene
epoxidation in the following order: He > N ∼
2
Ar > CH ,
4
which corre-
sponded to coke formation. Interestingly, the addition of CH in
4
the
He diluent gas, at a proper fraction, enhanced the ethylene epoxida-
tion performance for all studied catalysts, especially for long-term
activity.
