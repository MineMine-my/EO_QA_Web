enhance the activity of Ag/α-Al2O3 for EO production. An 82 % increase of the EO production rate, from 1.19 ×
10 (cid:0)2 to 2.17 ×10 (cid:0)2 mol/h/gAg, was achieved after induction at 260 ◦C. Suitable gas atmosphere (e.g., O2, C2H4,
and fully reactive gases) was found to be another requisite for successfully inducing the increase in the EO
production rate. O2-TPD analyses showed that more subsurface oxygen was generated in a suitable gas atmo-
sphere compared to N2. In-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy results elucidate the
formation of carbonates on the Ag surface after induction. The presence of carbonates stabilizes more subsurface
oxygen, facilitating the adsorption and dissociation of O2 and C2H4, thereby enhancing the reaction rate of the
ethylene epoxidation process. The induced high activity could be maintained stably, as there was no sign of
activity decrease over a 120-hour operation after induction. Due to the induced high activity, the Ag loading of
the catalyst can be reduced in industrial applications, effectively lowering production costs.

With an increase in EO production rate with induction procedures for
Ag/α-Al2O3, it is of great importance to examine whether the high EO

in EO formation rate or selectivity was observed, suggesting that the
successfully induced Ag/Al2O3 catalyst can maintain its EO activity over
a long period of operation.
In general, increasing the temperature leads to an increase in the
chemical reaction rate; however, it simultaneously decreases product
selectivity, a phenomenon known as the seesaw effect. This occurs
because, while the reaction rate increases with temperature, the reaction
rate of its side reaction, deep oxidation, also increases, resulting in a
decrease in selectivity for ethylene epoxidation [16,45–49]. Rojluechai,
