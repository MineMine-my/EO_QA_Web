All catalysts in Table 2 were prepared at 60(cid:1)C, 0.15g(cid:5)mL(cid:3)1 CC
extract and with 15wt.% Ag loading. It can be seen that without
calcination,theinitiationtemperatureofthebiosynthesizedcata-
lystwas230(cid:1)Cshowingpooractivityfortheethyleneepoxidation.
After calcination between 200–700(cid:1)C, the initiation temperature
of the catalysts decreased to 200(cid:1)C. After calcination at 800(cid:1)C,
the initiation temperature is up to 240(cid:1)C. These results indicate
thatthereactiontemperaturecanbeeffectivelyloweredbyappro-
priate calcination. Moreover, the catalytic performance was also
influenced by the calcination temperature. For example, at the
same reaction temperature of 220(cid:1)C, EO selectivity was close to
