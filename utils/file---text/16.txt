samples using a single exponential decay function. Fully chlorided small Ag particles exhibit low rates of
epoxidation and only large Ag particles which exhibit sub-monolayer Cl coverages catalyze ethylene epoxidation
with high ethylene oxide (EO) rates and selectivity. The Ag particle size dependence of Cl coverages plausibly
explains why ≥100 nm Ag particles are typical in promoted Ag/α-Al2O3 ethylene epoxidation catalysts.
