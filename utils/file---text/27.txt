sample names refer to the final Re loading after silver Ag, which might have increased the concentration of
anchoring sites for the Ag precursor. Since the Ag loading
and particle sizes are similar, differences in catalyst
performance can be ascribed to the influence of Re rather
than to Ag particle size effects or a different surface ratio
between Ag and α-alumina.13 The experimental loadings
determined with ICP were as expected, whereas the Re
loading determined with XPS was higher than the ICP
measurements. As XPS is a surface sensitive technique,
this means that the Re is preferentially located at the
surface rather than in the bulk of the material.

Without chloride, Re increased the EO selectivity while
lowering the conversion. The combination of chloride and
Re resulted in similar conversions and selectivities for
0.4Re–Ag and Ag, but the 2Re–Ag and 4Re–Ag showed a
decreased EO selectivity compared to Ag at equivalent
conversions. Including the industrially relevant ethyl
chloride, we show for the first time that these changes in
selectivity relate to the catalysts' EO isomerization behavior.
This shows that the effects of chloride and Re are not
